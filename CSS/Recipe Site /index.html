      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <h3>STEP 1</h3>
      <p>
        Heat the oven 170C/150C fan/gas 3. Put the flour, butter and sugar into
        a mixing bowl. Use your hands to combine the ingredients until the
        mixture looks like breadcrumbs, then squeeze until it comes together as
        a dough.
      </p>
      <h3>STEP 2</h3>
      <p>
        On a lightly floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll out the dough to
        Â½ cm thick. Cut the dough into fingers and place on a lined baking tray.
        Use a fork to create imprints, then sprinkle with the remaining caster
        sugar.
      </p>
      <h3>STEP 3</h3>
      <p>
        Chill the dough in the fridge for 20 mins, then bake for 15-20 mins
        until golden brown. Remove the shortbread fingers from the oven and
        leave to cool on the tray for 10 mins.
